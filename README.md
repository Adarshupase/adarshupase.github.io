Hi , I'm Adarsh 
Currently studying B.Tech Computer Science in PES University.


## MY Projects 
*I have done a lot of projects in various domains ranging from operating system concepts to machine learning and LLMs*
**
1. **Website Domain Predictor**(*TF-IDF*,*Logistic Regression*)   [Github](https://github.com/Adarshupase/TLD-Predictor) 
  - A web app that predicts the TLD's for a website given it's basename optionally it's category.
  - It also features an interactive guessing game .
  - play the game here [TLD-Predictor](https://tld-predictor-1.onrender.com/)
2. **Online Food Delivery System Using Spring Boot** [Github](https://github.com/Adarshupase/food-delivery-app)
  - While working on this project i learnt a lot about tradeoffs involved in using various design patterns.
  - I get to about various patterns ones i used were Creational , Structural and Behavioral Design patterns like *Abstract Factory* for providing Discounts for Customers, *Decorator* for different kinds of Menu Items and My favorite *Strategy* pattern for recommending food items to customers switching the recommender strategy dynamically.
3. **Dynamic file system**  [Github](https://github.com/Adarshupase/dynamic-file-system)
  - This is a minimal file system that i wrote when i was learning about operating system and the inner workings of file systems.
  - my idea was to make groups dynamic so they can adjust themselves when blocks are freed so to prevent fragmentation.
