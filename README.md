# Hi, I'm Adarsh Upase  

**B.Tech in Computer Science, PES University**  
I’m passionate about systems, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs).  
My interests span from operating system internals to applied AI and backend development.

## My Projects  

*I have worked on projects in various domains — from core operating system concepts to applied machine learning and system design.*

### [Website Domain Predictor](https://github.com/Adarshupase/TLD-Predictor)
**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression  
**Live Demo:** [TLD-Predictor](https://tld-predictor-1.onrender.com)

A web application that predicts the top-level domain (TLD) of a website given its basename and optionally its category.  
It also includes an interactive guessing game for users to test their intuition about web domains.

**Key Highlights**
- Implemented TF-IDF-based text vectorization.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model for accurate TLD prediction.
- Deployed using Flask and Render.

### [Online Food Delivery System (Spring Boot)](https://github.com/Adarshupase/food-delivery-app)
**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML/CSS

A full-stack food delivery system that demonstrates the practical use of multiple design patterns for scalability and maintainability.

**Concepts and Patterns Used**
- Abstract Factory: To provide dynamic discounts to customers.
- Decorator Pattern: For managing different kinds of menu items.
- Strategy Pattern: To switch between different recommendation algorithms dynamically.

This project deepened my understanding of architectural tradeoffs and design pattern applications in large systems.

### [Dynamic File System](https://github.com/Adarshupase/dynamic-file-system)
**Tech Stack:** C, FUSE, Linux

A minimal custom file system developed to explore the internal workings of operating systems and file management.

**Features**
- Implements dynamic group allocation to minimize fragmentation.
- Demonstrates block and inode management similar to ext-based file systems.
- Provides insight into how modern file systems handle space efficiency.
