## Projects  

### Website Domain Predictor
**github:** [link](https://github.com/Adarshupase/TLD-Predictor)
**Tech Stack:** Flask,ReactJS  
**Live Demo:** [TLD-Predictor](https://tld-predictor-1.onrender.com)

A web application that predicts the top-level domain (TLD) of a website given its basename and optionally its category.  
It also includes an interactive guessing game for users to test their intuition about web domains.

**Key Highlights**
- Implemented TF-IDF-based text vectorization.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model for accurate TLD prediction.
- Deployed using Flask and Render.

### Online Food Delivery System (Spring Boot)
**github:** [link](https://github.com/Adarshupase/food-delivery-app)
**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot,MYSQL

A full-stack food delivery system that demonstrates the practical use of multiple design patterns for scalability and maintainability.

**Concepts and Patterns Used**
- Abstract Factory: To provide dynamic customized discounts to customers.
- Decorator Pattern: For managing different kinds of menu items.
- Strategy Pattern: To switch between different recommendation algorithms dynamically.

This project deepened my understanding of architectural tradeoffs and design pattern applications in large systems.

### Dynamic File System
**github:** [link](https://github.com/Adarshupase/dynamic-file-system)
**Tech Stack:** C, Linux

A minimal custom file system developed to explore the internal workings of operating systems and file management.

**Features**
- Implements dynamic group allocation to minimize fragmentation.
- Demonstrates block and inode management similar to ext-based file systems.
- Provides insight into how modern file systems handle space efficiency.

### Vec - A header only library for vectors
**github:** [link](https://github.com/Adarshupase/Vec)
**Language:** C++
A header only library for vectors in c++ supporting vector operations similar to python lists
- Negative Indexing 
- slicing the vector
- support for multidimensional vectors

## Experience  
### CCBD and CDSAML, PES University (Jun-Aug 2025) 
- Fine-tuned a lightweight large language model (Mistral-7B) to translate natural-language queries into Elasticsearch DSL using Low Rank Adoption.
- Improved model accuracy to 71% (a 53% improvement over the base model) by fine-tuning Mistral-7B with LoRA on a custom dataset of 4,000 samples.
