## My Projects  

### [Website Domain Predictor](https://github.com/Adarshupase/TLD-Predictor)
**Tech Stack:** Flask,ReactJS
**Live Demo:** [TLD-Predictor](https://tld-predictor-1.onrender.com)

A web application that predicts the top-level domain (TLD) of a website given its basename and optionally its category.  
It also includes an interactive guessing game for users to test their intuition about web domains.

**Key Highlights**
- Implemented TF-IDF-based text vectorization.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model for accurate TLD prediction.
- Deployed using Flask and Render.

### [Online Food Delivery System (Spring Boot)](https://github.com/Adarshupase/food-delivery-app)
**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot,MYSQL

A full-stack food delivery system that demonstrates the practical use of multiple design patterns for scalability and maintainability.

**Concepts and Patterns Used**
- Abstract Factory: To provide dynamic customized discounts to customers.
- Decorator Pattern: For managing different kinds of menu items.
- Strategy Pattern: To switch between different recommendation algorithms dynamically.

This project deepened my understanding of architectural tradeoffs and design pattern applications in large systems.
